    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Some pretty good buffalo chicken that is quick and easy to make.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe is for 1 serving but I typically but enough to make 5 days worth. 
        I also usually make veggies along with something like fries, potato wedges, or rice to go with this.

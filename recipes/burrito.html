    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Some great burritos that are filling and tasty. They are made to have lots of protein
        and not too high in calories.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe is for 1 serving but I typically make however many I can with the amount of meat I purchased,
        freezing any burritos I won't eat within ~4 days.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10''/25cm Wheat Tortilla [x6]</li>
        <li>Ground beef (or chicken/turkey) [2 lbs] (900g)</li>
        <li>Yellow Onion [250g]</li>
        <li>Sieved or puree canned tomato [300g]</li>
        <li>Laughing cow wedges [x4]</li>
        <li>Shredded mozzarella [120g]</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>(Optional) Salsa verde</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>With 300g of canned tomato; add ~1 tbsp. Salt, ~1.5 tbsp. Black pepper, ~2 tsp. Oregano then Mix.</li>
        <li>Dice onions.</li>
        <li>Use a big pan with oil on medium-high.</li>
        <li>Add beef for 4-5 minutes. While cooking add some salt and black pepper as needed along with ~1 tsp. of garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Stir occasionally until mostly brown then add chopped onion, continue to stir.</li>
        <li>After ~11 minutes add tomato sauce then stir well.</li>
        <li>Add 4 cheese wedges, stirring for a few minutes until cheese is melted in with beef.</li>
        <li>Now add 120g of shredded mozzarella and stir again until melted</li>
        <ul>
            <li>(Optional) Add to plate and let cool in fridge or on counter so the hot beef does not cause tortillas to become soggy and weak.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Lay burrito on aluminum foil (optionally also use parchment paper to make reheating better) then add ~250g of meat on each tortilla and roll up burrito then wrap burrito in aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Put burritos in the fridge or in a ziploc bag then in the freezer.</li>
    </ol>
